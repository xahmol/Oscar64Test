== Name

cc1541 - A tool for creating Commodore 1541 Floppy disk images
in D64, D71 or D81 format with custom sector interleaving etc.
Also supports extended tracks 35-40 using either SPEED DOS or
DOLPHIN DOS BAM-formatting.

== Synopsis

*cc1541* [_options_] image.[_d64|d71|d81_]

== Options

*-n diskname*::
  Disk name, default='cc1541'.

*-i id*::
  Disk ID, default='00 2a'.

*-H message*::
  Hidden BAM message. Only for D64 (up to 85 chars) or SPEED DOS
(up to 20 chars).

*-w localname*::
  Write local file to disk, if filename is not set then the local
name is used.  After file written, the filename is unset.

*-W localname*::
  Like -w, but encode file in Transwarp format.

*-K key*::
  Set an encryption key for Transwarp files, a string of up to 29
  characters.

*-f filename*::
  Use filename as name when writing next file, use prefix _#_ to
include arbitrary PETSCII characters (e.g. -f "START#a0,8,1").

*-o*::
  Do not overwrite if file with same name exists already.

*-V*::
  Do not modify image unless it is in valid CBM DOS format.

*-T filetype*::
  Filetype for next file, allowed parameters are PRG, SEQ, USR, REL
and DEL, or a decimal number between 0 and 255. Default is PRG.

*-P*::
  Set write protect flag for next file.

*-O*::
  Set open flag for next file.

*-N*::
  Force creation of a new directory entry, even if a file with the
  same name exists already.

*-l filename*::
  Write loop file (an additional dir entry) to existing file to disk,
set filename with -f.

*-L*::
  Add dir entry without writing file (track and sector will be 0),
requires a filename given with -f.

*-B numblocks*::
  Write the given value as file size in blocks to the directory for
the next file.

*-M numchars*::
  Hash computation maximum filename length, this must match loader
option FILENAME_MAXLENGTH in Krill's loader.  Default is 16.

*-m*::
  Ignore filename hash collisions, without this switch a collision
results in an error.

*-d track*::
  Maintain a shadow directory (copy of the actual directory without a
valid BAM).

*-t*::
  Use directory track to also store files (makes -x useless) (default no).

*-u numblocks*::
  When using -t, amount of dir blocks to leave free (default=2).

*-x*::
  Don't split files over directory track hole (default split files).

*-F*::
  Next file first sector on a new track (default=0).  Any negative
value assumes aligned tracks and uses current sector + interleave - value.
After each file, the value falls back to the default.  Not applicable
for D81.

*-S value*::
  Default sector interleave, default=10. Not applicable for D81.

*-s value*::
  Next file sector interleave, valid after each file. The interleave value
falls back to the default value set by -S after the first sector of the
next file. Not applicable for D81.

*-e*::
  Start next file on an empty track (default start sector is current
sector plus interleave).

*-E*::
  Try to fit file on a single track.

*-r track*::
  Restrict next file blocks to the specified track or higher.

*-b sector*::
  Set next file beginning sector to the specified value.  Not
applicable for D81.

*-c*::
  Save next file cluster-optimized (d71 only).

*-4*::
  Use tracks 35-40 with SPEED DOS BAM formatting.

*-5*::
  Use tracks 35-40 with DOLPHIN DOS BAM formatting.

*-R level*::
  Try to restore deleted and formatted files.
level 0: Only restore all dir entries without touching any t/s links.
level 1: Fix dir entries for files with valid t/s chains.
level 2: Also add wild sector chains with valid t/s chains.
level 3: Also fix dir entries with invalid t/s chains.
level 4: Also add and fix wild invalid t/s chains.
level 5: Also add reasonable wild single blocks.

*-g filename*::
  Write additional g64 output file with given name.

*-a*::
Print command line options that would create the same directory as the
one in the given image (for directory art import).

*-U mapping*::
  Print PETSCII as Unicode (requires Unicode 13.0 font, e.g. UNSCII).
Use mapping 0 for ASCII output, 1 for upper case, 2 for lower case,
default is 0.

*-q*::
  Be quiet.

*-v*::
  Be verbose.

*-h*::
  Print command line help.

== Exit status

*0*::
  Success.

*-1*::
  Failure.
